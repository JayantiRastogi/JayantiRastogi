ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JayantiRastogi
I am a self-motivated individual currently pursuing a Data Science certification from Scaler Academy. With a strong academic foundation, including an M.Tech in Digital Communications, I am now channeling my full focus toward building a career in Data Science, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.
I am highly adaptable, eager to learn, and unburdened by preconceptions (being a late starter), which allows me to approach challenges with a fresh perspective and open mind.
My determination to excel is evident in my commitment to mastering cutting-edge tools and techniques in data science.

## What Iâ€™m Working On:

* Data Projects: Analyzing diverse datasets, developing models, and generating actionable insights using SQL, Python, and visualization tools.
* Machine Learning: Exploring supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms while developing an understanding of model deployment strategies.
* Customer Analytics: Identifying patterns and trends to drive data-driven decisions in customer segmentation and product optimization.

## Skills and Interests:

* Data Science: EDA, statistical modeling, data wrangling, feature engineering, and ETL processes.
* Visualization: Proficient in Tableau, Power BI, and Matplotlib for impactful storytelling through data.
* Programming: Hands-on experience with Python, SQL, and data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
* Machine Learning: Familiar with classification, regression, and clustering techniques.
* Analytical Thinking: Developed through teaching mathematics and solving real-world problems.
* Team Collaboration: Excited to contribute fresh perspectives and foster an inclusive and innovative work environment.

## Letâ€™s Connect!
I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and continue growing in a challenging and dynamic role. Whether itâ€™s collaborating on machine learning models, conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis, or driving business insights, I am eager to contribute and learn.
